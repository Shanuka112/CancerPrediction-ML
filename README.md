# Cancer Prediction through Machine Learning: Early Detection and Insights

## Executive Summary:
Cancer stands as a significant cause of mortality globally, with early diagnosis proving pivotal in improving patient survival rates. To address this, our project aims to construct an algorithm leveraging machine learning models. By analyzing diverse patient data encompassing crucial factors such as age, gender, genetic predisposition, and environmental influences like tobacco use and radon exposure, our goal is to predict the likelihood of lung cancer occurrence. This predictive model holds the potential to reduce cancer-related fatalities by enabling early identification.

## Introduction:
Focusing on the histological classification of lung cancers, our analysis considers 24 parameters influencing cancer development. Factors such as tobacco use, secondhand smoke exposure, and radon are pivotal in understanding cancer risk. Through a meticulously structured dataset, dividing records into training, validation, and test sets, we aim to train and verify model accuracy, subsequently predicting cancer occurrence in unforeseen cases.

## Approach:
1. Data selection and cleaning
2. Utilization of diverse machine learning algorithms
3. Training and testing models
4. Accurate assessment of model performance

## Data Requirements:
We've outlined 12 critical data prerequisites, encompassing the need for large, diverse, labeled, and well-documented datasets, essential for training and testing our predictive model. Additionally, considerations such as meaningful features, fewer missing values, and balanced data are crucial in ensuring model accuracy.
